I recently completed QuickStart's Cybersecurity bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with network security, system hardening, and vulnerability assessments. I'm now seeking to launch a career in cybersecurity, where I can apply my skills to protect and defend digital infrastructure. Currently, I'm preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification to further strengthen my technical foundation. My main projects are:

- [Creating A Virtual Network](https://youtu.be/APskQiKWE8M)
- [Internal Network Vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/7aJYZqbF838)
- [Pentest Sim CTF](https://youtu.be/y08Rz5pcZNI)
