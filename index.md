I recently completed QuickStart's Cybersecurity bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with network security, system hardening, and vulnerability assessments. I'm now seeking to launch a career in cybersecurity, where I can apply my skills to protect and defend digital infrastructure. Currently, I'm preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification to further strengthen my technical foundation. My main projects are:

- Project 1 [Creating A Virtual Network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15mPAJ-JGdD8Lmb3s5OlUIlqk5w58WicX/view?usp=drive_link)
- Project 2 [Internal Network Vulnerabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VWyXt_zqTkvaAZIhJrJydUcnSTsK3zhx/view?usp=drive_link)
- Project 3 [Pentest Sim CTF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14TD1pn0aMaanocGu-SEWMthzJXKlYJSD/view?usp=drive_link)
